From a high level, Hotplug is a kernel mechanism to 'inform' user space that a new devices has been added (usb/pcie...). Based on the devices identification tag (devid/vendorid...), user space will load the appropriate driver. AER is the error path and is not involve in the hotplug mechanism;

Internally, kernel receive an event that indicates that something happen on a particular 'slot'; The notification mechanism can be initiated by the BIOS (ACPI) or the controller itself.

In the cases of ACPI notification (BIOS), the kernel rely on ACPI to fetch the devices configuration (enumerated by BIOS); Kernel runs pci_fixup to 'repair' minor incompatibilities.

In the cases of a host controller notification, the devices is 'discover' through 

'Unpluging' a devices from a running system usually require 'manual' intervention (stopping traffic, un-mounting filesystem...) _before_ pulling the physical card in order to avoid AER on the link.

Hotplug event can be generated by BIOS (ACPI) or the controller itself; In our cases I supposed that the host controller will provide support
