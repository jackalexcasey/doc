/*
 * KMMIO clear PTE_PRESENT on ioremap pages
 * When accessed there is a page_fault. The fault is analyzed an if it 
 * originate from kmmio, the pre_handler is called
 * then the CPU is put in single stepping and the PTE_PRESENT is set.
 *
 * <<< HERE it's possible that another CPU miss the notification when accessing
 * the page because the PTE_PRESENT is set and the local CPU enter the DEBUG exception.
 *
 * ? Can we handle emulation from pre_handler instead???
 *
 * The execution resume out of the page_fault and goes back to debug exception
 * the debug exception is using the die_notifier callback; From that level
 * the post handler is called. After it complete it re-arm the kmmio i.e.
 * clear PTE_PRESENT

	Add support to set/clear pte presence on user page as well

diff --git a/arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c b/arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c
	The pte lookup is already present for kernel page; add the 
	lookup for userspace PTE; Maybe there is other code already for this one
		pte_t *lookup_uaddress(unsigned long address, struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned int *level)

	in kernel ioremap are calling into mmiotrace_ioremap already so
	we call out to our own vdev_register_mapping; This needs cleanup

	Coming from process fork where the addres space is duplicated.
	We are about to copy a VMA that has PFN mapping with potentially
	mmio tracking PTE i.e. _PAGE_PRESENT PTE clear.
	HERE we DROP the tracking for that cases:
		For linear PFN mapping we call out vdev_unregister_mapping((void*)vma->vm_start);
