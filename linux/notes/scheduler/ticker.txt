Kernel use a tickless timer i.e.CONFIG_NO_HZ) enables 'on-demand' timer 
interrupts: if there is no timer to be expired for say 1.5 seconds when 
the system goes idle, then the system will stay totally idle for 1.5 
seconds.

When the system goes idle _what_ else than timer can wake up a process ( IRQ, Network IO -> pool OR timer )
No need to tick when we are idle
