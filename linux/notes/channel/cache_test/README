With [Westmere-EP], Intel uses its 32 nm process to add cores and cache, rather than push integration. As a result, we have up to a six-core processor with 12 MB of shared L3 cache. Architecturally, [Westmere-EP] is otherwise the same as [Nehalem-EP]. Each core gets 32 KB of L1 instruction cache, 32 KB of L1 data cache, and a dedicated 256 KB L2 cache.


es—each with a 32KB, four-way set associative instruction cache, a 32KB, eight-way set associative data cache, and a private, low-latency 256KB L2 cache—all attached to an inclusive L3 cache that will be sized to fit the number of cores and target market.
