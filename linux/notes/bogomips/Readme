 At boot time the TSC is initialized;
	-tsc_init()
	- On HOST The calibration of the TSC is native_calibrate_tsc()
	  PIT (quick_pit_calibrate())  loop OR HPET value
	  dmesg  |grep TSC
	  [    0.000000] Fast TSC calibration using PIT
	  [    1.914783] Refined TSC clocksource calibration: 1595.885 MHz.

	==> This gives us the tsc_khz  and cpu_khz = tsc_khz;
	dmesg |grep Detected
	[    0.004000] Detected 1595.956 MHz processor.

	This is done for the boot CPU only;
		assuming the same speed as the bootup CPU. (cpufreq notifiers will fix this
		up if their speed diverges)

	Then if the TSC is stable:
		lpj = ((u64)tsc_khz * 1000);
		do_div(lpj, HZ);
		lpj_fine = lpj;

		>>>
		>>> 1595.956 * 1000 = 1595956
		>>> CONFIG_HZ_1000=y
		>>> CONFIG_HZ=1000

		lpj * 4  ???

 	dmesg |grep lpj
	[    0.000002] Calibrating delay loop (skipped), value calculated using timer frequency.. 3191.94 BogoMIPS (lpj=6383896)

	So the calibration is skipped; We know how many TSC cycle there is in 1 jiffie period.

bogomips:
~~~~~~~~
>>> sudo insmod bogomips.ko
This test know the calibrated lpj for each CPU; Something like:
	[ 5901.042266] CPU 0 : lpj 6383824
	[ 5901.042272] CPU 1 : lpj 6383307
	[ 5901.042275] CPU 2 : lpj 6383305
	[ 5901.042279] CPU 3 : lpj 6383307
Each CPU run at their own frequency.

The test measure the number of cycle it takes to count up to lpj of that CPU.
Note that it will execute on the current CPU so put your shell on the CPU you want
	taskset -pc 3 6282



The per CPU output value:
	CPU 0 : lpj 6383824
	[15192.463878] 11785548
	[15192.463898] 11785545
	[15192.463904] CPU 1 : lpj 6383307
	[15192.537706] 11784621
	[15192.537709] 11784588

is a _delay loop (lpj); In other word how much TSC cycle for (lpj) iteration.

>>> 11785548 cycle for 6383824 loop => 1.846158039 CPU cycle per loop
>>>
>>> 11784588 cycle for 6383307 loop  => 1.846157172 CPU cycle per loop

*** If using no preemption and cpu throtolling is enabled it may give 
bad result since the frequency is not maxed out.

Using bogomips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bogomips will do a delay_loop() of 10Xlpj ad measure delta TSC

7300462 cycle for 6383824*10 loop
7303514


>>> LPJ measure the number of tick over a period of time/// The 'loop' per jiffie is a legacy name since the looping
>>> in SW is not happenning anymore...
 The loop represent the number of CPU bus cycle loop in this case.
